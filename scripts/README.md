./scripts/manage.sh dev

# Or use the direct script
./scripts/dev_start.sh --port 8000
```

### Full Backend Setup
```bash
# Complete backend startup with all services
./scripts/manage.sh start

# Or use the direct script
./scripts/start_backend.sh --environment development
```

## üìã Script Checklist

Before using the scripts, ensure:
- [ ] Virtual environment is created and activated
- [ ] Database is accessible and configured
- [ ] Redis is running (for caching and Celery)
- [ ] Required environment variables are set
- [ ] Scripts have execute permissions (`chmod +x scripts/*.sh`)
- [ ] Dependencies are installed (`pip install -r requirements.txt`)

## üéØ Best Practices

1. **Always use the management script** (`manage.sh`) for common operations
2. **Run health checks** before and after deployments
3. **Monitor logs** regularly for issues
4. **Perform regular maintenance** using the maintenance script
5. **Test in development** before production deployment
6. **Keep backups** of database and configuration
7. **Use environment-specific configurations**
8. **Monitor system resources** and performance metrics
