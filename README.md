# Backend_PRS - Payment Receiving System Backend

## Overview

Backend_PRS is a comprehensive Django REST Framework-based backend system for a Payment Receiving System (PRS). It provides a complete multi-tenant SaaS solution for managing sales operations, client relationships, payment processing, and commission tracking with role-based access control.

## System Architecture

### Core Components

- **Django 5.2.2** - Web framework
