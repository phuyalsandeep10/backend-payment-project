## Key Findings

### ✅ Model Relationships Analysis
**Status: EXCELLENT**

#### PaymentInvoice Model
- **Fields:** 8 core fields including automatic invoice_id generation
- **Relationships:** 
  - OneToOneField to Payment (primary relationship)
  - ForeignKey to Deal (for organization scoping)
  - Reverse ForeignKey from PaymentApproval (for approval tracking)
- **Key Features:**
  - Automatic invoice ID generation with race condition protection
  - File upload with security validation
  - Status tracking: pending, verified, rejected, refunded, bad_debt
  - Signal-based automatic creation when Payment is created

#### PaymentApproval Model
- **Fields:** 10 core fields including amount verification and remarks
- **Relationships:**
  - ForeignKey to Payment (links to payment being approved)
  - ForeignKey to PaymentInvoice (links to invoice being processed)
  - ForeignKey to Deal (auto-assigned from payment)
  - ForeignKey to User (tracks approving verifier)
- **Key Features:**
  - Multiple approval states via failure_remarks
  - File upload with automatic image compression
  - Amount verification tracking
  - Automatic deal assignment from payment relationship

### ✅ Dashboard Functionality Analysis
