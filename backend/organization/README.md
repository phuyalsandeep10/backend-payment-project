# Organization App

This app manages organizations and their administrators within the Payment Receiving System. It allows super administrators to create, view, update, and delete organizations and their associated admins.

## File Structure and Purpose

-   `__init__.py`: Marks this directory as a Python package.
-   `admin.py`: (Not yet implemented) Will be used to register Organization models with the Django admin site.
-   `apps.py`: Contains the application configuration for the `organization` app.
-   `migrations/`: Stores the database migration files generated by Django.
-   `models.py`: Defines the database schema for the `Organization` model.
-   `permissions.py`: Contains custom permission classes, such as `IsSuperAdmin`, to protect API endpoints.
-   `serializers.py`: Includes serializers (`OrganizationSerializer`, `OrgAdminSerializer`, `OrganizationRegistrationSerializer`) that handle the conversion of model instances to and from JSON.
-   `tests.py`: For writing unit and integration tests for the app.
-   `urls.py`: Defines the URL routing for the app, mapping endpoints to their corresponding views.
-   `views.py`: Contains the business logic for the API, including `ModelViewSet`s for CRUD operations on organizations and admins.

## Database Design

The `organization` app has one primary model:

### `Organization`

| Field      | Type              | Description                                  |
|------------|-------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| `name`     | `CharField`       | The unique name of the organization.         |
| `is_active`| `BooleanField`    | Indicates if the organization is active.     |
| `created_at`| `DateTimeField`   | Timestamp of when the organization was created.|
| `updated_at`| `DateTimeField`   | Timestamp of the last update.                |

### Relationships

-   A **User** (from the `authentication` app) can be associated with one **Organization**. This is defined by a `ForeignKey` in the `User` model.
-   A **User** with the `ORG_ADMIN` role is considered an administrator for their assigned organization.
