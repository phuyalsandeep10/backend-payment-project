```

### Health Checks
Monitor optimization health through:
- Dashboard metrics
- Background task status
- Cache performance
- Error rates and logs

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **High Memory Usage**
   - Reduce batch sizes
   - Increase cache TTL
   - Monitor query complexity

2. **Slow Optimization**
   - Check database indexes
   - Optimize query patterns
