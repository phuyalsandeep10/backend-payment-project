Django Apps Directory - Task 3.2.1

This directory contains all Django application modules for better organization.
Applications are grouped here to separate them from core system components,
services, and utilities.

Apps Structure:
- authentication/        # User authentication and authorization
- clients/              # Client management  
- commission/           # Commission calculations
- deals/                # Deal management and workflows
- notifications/        # Notification system
- organization/         # Organization management
- permissions/          # Permission system
- project/              # Project management
- Sales_dashboard/      # Sales dashboard functionality
- team/                 # Team management
- Verifier_dashboard/   # Verifier dashboard functionality

All apps have been moved from backend root to improve directory organization
and maintain clear separation of concerns.
