# Requirements Management - Task 3.3.3

Organized dependency management for different deployment environments.

## Structure

```
requirements/
├── README.md           # This file
├── base.txt            # Core dependencies (all environments)
├── development.txt     # Development and testing dependencies
└── production.txt      # Production-specific dependencies
```

## Base Requirements (`base.txt`)
Core dependencies required in all environments:
- Django and Django REST Framework
- Database drivers and utilities
- Core application dependencies
- Third-party integrations

## Development Requirements (`development.txt`)
Additional dependencies for development:
- Testing frameworks (pytest, coverage)
- Code formatting (black, isort)
- Linting and type checking (flake8, mypy)
- Development tools (debug toolbar)
- API testing tools

## Production Requirements (`production.txt`)
Production-specific optimizations:
- WSGI server (gunicorn)
- Production database drivers
- Performance optimization tools
- Monitoring and error reporting
- Security enhancements

## Usage

### Development Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements/development.txt
```

### Production Environment
```bash
pip install -r requirements/production.txt
```

### Base Only (Minimal)
```bash
pip install -r requirements/base.txt
```

## Maintenance

1. **Adding New Dependencies**:
   - Add to `base.txt` if needed in all environments
   - Add to `development.txt` for dev-only tools
   - Add to `production.txt` for prod-only optimizations

2. **Version Updates**:
   - Pin specific versions for stability
   - Test thoroughly before updating major versions
   - Document breaking changes in commit messages

3. **Security Updates**:
   - Regularly scan for security vulnerabilities
   - Update vulnerable packages promptly
   - Use `safety` tool for automated checking
